1. Design and develop a Java Program to calculate the CGPA of grades obtained in four subjects (each out of 10) by student 'Sam' and in three subject (each out of 10) by student 'John'. Create an abstract class 'Grade' with an abstract method 'getCGPA()'. It is inherited by two other classes 'Sam' and 'John' each having a method with the same name which returns the CGPA of the students. The constructor of student 'Sam' takes the grades in four subjects as its parameters and the grades in three subjects as its parameters for student 'John'. Create an object for each of the two classes and print the CGPA of grades for both the student.
