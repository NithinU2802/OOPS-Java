              For instance you are selected  for the internship at "Sun Micro System Company" and company is currently working on "Climate Change" project. As a part of project implementation your "Team Lead(TL)" assigned a sequence of tasks related to 
temperature data and sea-level rise and details are given below.

1. Create a user defined two custom packages and named it as "Climate_Temperature" and "Climate_SLR".
2. Create a Class "Temperature" in "Climate_Temperature" package and write a method "Read_Temp()" to store the "temperature" values using array Scanner class and display the temperature data using "Dis_Temp()".
3. Create a class "Sea_Level_Rise" in "Climate_SLR" package and write and a method "Read_SLR()" to store the "sea-level raise' values using array scanner class and display the Sea-Level Rise using 'Disp_SLR()".
4. Create a class "CC_Mean and import two packages("Climate_Temperature" and "Climate_SLR") and implement two methods "Mean_Temp()" and "Mean_SLR()" to calculate the average temperature and sea-level rise from 1982-2020 and displaydata using "Disp_CC".
