2. Suppose you opened a new Pizza shop where you provide a pepsi at a reasonable price as an Addon with the pizza. Now create a package myshop and inside the package create a class MyPizza where the price of the pepsi and price of the pizza are two data members. Define two methods addonCost() and pizzaCost() which will display the cost of the ordered pizza. Create another java program with a class MyAddon which will import the package myshop and invoke the method addonCost(). Assume that the customer has ordered each food item only once. Get the items and prices as an user inputs.
